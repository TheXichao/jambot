## Requirements
- Python 3.6 and up - https://www.python.org/downloads/
- git - https://git-scm.com/download/

## Useful to always have
Keep [this](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) saved somewhere, as this is the docs to discord.py@rewrite.
All you need to know about the library is defined inside here, even code that I don't use in this example is here.

## How to setup
1. Make a bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and grab the token

2. Rename the file **config.json.example** to **config.json**, then fill in the required spots, such as token, prefix and game

3. To install what you need, do **pip install -r requirements.txt**<br>
(If that doesn't work, do **python -m pip install -r requirements.txt**)<br>
`NOTE: Use pip install with Administrator/sudo`

4. Start the bot by having the cmd/terminal inside the bot folder and type **python index.py**

5. You're done, enjoy your bot!


# Optional tools
### Flake8
Flake8 is a tool that helps you keep your code clean. Most coding softwares will have a plugin that supports this Python module so it can be integrated with your IDE. To install it, simply do `pip install flake8`. If you're using python 3.7, install by doing `pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8#egg=flake8`

### PM2
PM2 is an alternative script provided by NodeJS, which will reboot your bot whenever it crashes and keep it up with a nice status. You can install it by doing `npm install -g pm2` and you should be done. Keep in mind that this PM2 file is made to work on my own Linux instance, you might need to change the `interpreter` value.
```
# Start the bot
